# cardBasedLayout

- Professional cards with course images, category badges, level labels, and call-to-action buttons

- Data-driven layout: all cards are configured in a single `cardData` array in `App.js`

**Update visuals:**  
Modify `.custom-card`, `.custom-card:hover`, and related styles in `src/App.css` to tweak colors, shadows, or animation speed.
